## About the Author

Hello! I'm Gillian.  
I began my career in public accounting after graduating from Fordham University with a BS/MS in Accounting and Taxation. While working in financial services, I realized the growing demand for innovation through technological solutions. I left my compliance role to pursue a career in software development. I am pursuing my second bachelors in Computer Science at Hunter College and will graduate in May 2020.


### More Information

As a believer in learning by doing, I interned at Bank of America as a Global Tech Analyst in the summer of 2019 and will be joining the bank fulltime in July 2020.
