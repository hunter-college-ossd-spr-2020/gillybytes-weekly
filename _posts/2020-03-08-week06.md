### Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 1

#### Project Selection: Zulip
Our team chose [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/). Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines the immediacy of real-time chat with an email threading model. We chose Zulip because it is primarily written in Python, which is a language we are all familiar with, and for its welcoming community. I navigated around the project repository and read relevant documentation. My activites related to Zulip for the week are chronicled below:
