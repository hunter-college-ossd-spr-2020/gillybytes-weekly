## Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 5

Last Two Week's Tasks:
- [X] Ask for clarification regarding our issue
- [X] Code a solution
- [X] Issue a pull request
- [X] Find new issue

This week our team managed to code a solution and issue our first pull request. However, our solution did not pass the tests. We are now focusing on how to run the tests and to make sure our code passes these tests. I believe that our commit messages must follow a specific format. I have found guidance in the Zulip documentation and have shared this with the team. In addition, our group has learned to look for and claim issues early because of the high activity in the community. We have also learned that the Zulip chat server is more active and more reliable than the issue tracker. 

By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Re-issue pull request
- [ ] Code solution for next issue
- [ ] Issue another pull request, but for the second issue
- [ ] Claim another issue


## Guest Speaker: Gil Yehuda

About two weeks ago, Senior Director of Technology Strategy at Verizon Gil Yehuda spoke to our class. He discussed the evolution of the open source movement, the complexities of the relationship between the proprietary software industry and open source, and offered advice for how to launch a career with open source. Gil gave a comprehensive presentation on the history of open source and how companies use OSS. What impressed me the most was that Gil was a former opponent of open source software and now spoke highly in its favor. From a business perspective, I can understand why firms are strictly against open source. However, Gil was able to demonstrate the intrinsic benefits of open source and explain how companies like Verizon can position themselves toward better financial outcomes because of open source.


## Folding@Home

Folding@Home is a distributed computing project run by Stanford University with the goal of examining how proteins fold. Researching various diseases is achieved through shared computing power. The project asks users to download their software and to help them run simulations. The benefit of engaging in this project is that you do not need to be highly technical in the field to assist scientists and researchers in finding cures for diseases. The more people involved, the more processing power there is to simulate protein folding and ultimately the faster we will see results. Please share [this project](https://foldingathome.org/covid19/) with everyone you know!
