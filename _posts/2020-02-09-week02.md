### My Open Source Goals

To be an active member of the OSS movement, I plan to contribute to one or more open source projects during the course of this semester. I would like to discover new open source software and explore the features of such technologies. I look forward to engaging in the community by asking questions and discussing new ideas with fellow contributors. I would also like to read existing documentation and learn to write good documentation. Lastly, I hope to test code written by other developers and report any bugs, suggest new features, provide feedback etc.

Working in Open Source benefits me other than giving me the satisfaction of making a contribution to a project. 

Benefits to My Skills:
* To sharpen programming skills and learn to write clean code
* Communicate effectively and collaborate with others

Benefits to My Career:
* Increase job prospects

Benefits to My Personal Network:
* Increase community and peer recognition
* Meet like-minded people and potential mentors

Benefits from Preparation:
* Build an outstanding portfolio
